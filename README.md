# SwinjectMVVMExample

**[OBSOLETED] This example app is obsoleted and no longer follow the latest Xcode/Swift/Swinject versions.**

--- 

This is an example project to demonstrate [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) in [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) architecture with [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa). The app asynchronously searches, downloads and displays images obtained from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) via [its API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).

## Requirements

- Xcode 8.0 or later
- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) 0.17.2 or later
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) API key

(Xcode 7 version with Swift 2.2 is [here](https://github.com/Swinject/SwinjectMVVMExample/tree/swinject-v1))

## Setup

1. Download the source code or clone the repository.
2. Run `carthage bootstrap --no-use-binaries --platform iOS`.
3. Get a free API key from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). It is displayed in [the API documentation page](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) after you log in there.
4. Create a text file named `Pixabay.Config.swift` with the following content in `ExampleModel` folder in the project. The string `"YOUR_API_KEY"` should be replaced with your own key.

**Pixabay.Config.swift**

    extension Pixabay {
        internal struct Config {
            internal static let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
    }
